## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

The VerSe dataset consists of full-body CT scans enriched with aberrant cases. Anomalies in the lumbosacral region (a rather small part of the whole scan) can be rated via the Castellvi system (see https://radiopaedia.org/articles/castellvi-classification-of-lumbosacral-transitional-vertebrae). Although relatively easy to manually detect, it would still take a lot of time to rate huge datasets by hand. With a given expert grading of the data, the goal is to automate this process and predict the castellvi anomalies with a solid uncertainty estimation.


## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
~/3D-Castellvi-Prediction$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

First create an experiments folder in working dir
```
~/3D-Castellvi-Prediction$ mkdir experiments
~/3D-Castellvi-Prediction/experiments$ mkdir baseline_models
~/3D-Castellvi-Prediction/experiments/baseline_models$ mkdir densenet
~/3D-Castellvi-Prediction/experiments/baseline_models/densenet$ mkdir best_models
~/3D-Castellvi-Prediction/experiments/baseline_models/densenet$ mkdir lightning_logs

```

Update settings based on your local environment
```
data_root : <abs_path of dataset folders>
master_list : <abs_path of master_list file where you located>
experiments : <abs_path of experiments folder>
test_data_path : <abs path of where you want to save test image names>
```

Update train_model.sh
```
1. change bids toolbox path in python_env section
2. update the path of settings.yaml file 
```


## üîß Running the training <a name = "tests"></a>


Run the bashscript

```
~/3D-Castellvi-Prediction/src$ bash train_model.sh
```
