# 3D-Castellvi-Prediction
The VerSe dataset consists of full-body CT scans enriched with aberrant cases. Anomalies in the lumbosacral region (a rather small part of the whole scan) can be rated via the Castellvi system (see https://radiopaedia.org/articles/castellvi-classification-of-lumbosacral-transitional-vertebrae). Although relatively easy to manually detect, it would still take a lot of time to rate huge datasets by hand. With a given expert grading of the data, the goal is to automate this process and predict the castellvi anomalies with a solid uncertainty estimation.
